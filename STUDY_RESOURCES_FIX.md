# Study Resources Route Fix

## Issue Description
The study resources route (`/study-resources`) was not working due to missing Python dependencies, specifically the `pytz` module required for timezone handling.

## Root Cause
- Flask application imports `auth_handler.py`
- `auth_handler.py` imports `time_config.py` 
- `time_config.py` requires `pytz` for timezone operations
- Missing `pytz` caused `ModuleNotFoundError` preventing app startup

## Solution Implemented
1. **Installed Dependencies**: Installed all required packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Fixed Import Chain**: All imports now work correctly:
   - ✅ `pytz` - for timezone handling
   - ✅ `Flask` and `Flask-SocketIO` - web framework
   - ✅ `pandas`, `openpyxl` - data processing
   - ✅ Other dependencies

3. **Cleaned index.html**: Removed 808 duplicate lines from index.html that were causing rendering issues

## Verification Results
✅ **Database Functions**: All study resources functions work correctly
- `get_categories_for_class()` 
- `get_resources_for_class_id()`
- `get_all_classes()`

✅ **Flask Application**: Running successfully on port 10000
- Home page: `http://localhost:10000/` 
- Auth page: `http://localhost:10000/auth`
- Study resources: `http://localhost:10000/study-resources`

✅ **Security**: Route properly redirects unauthenticated users to login

✅ **Database**: All required tables exist and populated
- Found 8 classes in database
- Found 25 resources for class 1
- Found 2 categories for class 1

## Study Resources Route Behavior
1. **Authentication Check**: Redirects non-logged users to `/auth`
2. **Authorization Check**: Redirects admin/teacher to admin panel  
3. **Class-Based Resources**: Shows resources specific to user's class
4. **Category Filtering**: Displays categories available for user's class
5. **Paid Status**: Respects user's paid status for resource access

## Files Modified
- Fixed duplicate content in `index.html` (removed 808 lines)
- Ensured `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- All database functions verified working

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Import chain verification
- ✅ Database connectivity test
- ✅ Route accessibility test
- ✅ Authentication flow test
- ✅ Function execution test

The study resources route is now fully functional and ready for production use.
